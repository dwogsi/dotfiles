Dotfiles
========

My configuration dot files.

Feel free to pick what you need !

.zshrc
------

My *.zshrc* is generated by *.oh-my-zsh.* See https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

It won't work with your ZSH if you don't install *oh-my-zsh* first.

It also define *most* as the default pager, so make sure you installed it before using my ZSH configuration file.

### Install *most* pager

On debian:

    sudo apt-get install most

Here is how to define *most* as the default pager.

    sudo update-alternatives --config pager
