.zshrc
------

My *.zshrc* is generated by *.oh-my-zsh*. It won't work if you don't install *oh-my-zsh* first.

It also define *most* as the default pager, so make sure you installed it before using my ZSH configuration file.

### Install *oh-my-zsh*

See https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh or just
run the following command. No need to be root, it install
*oh-my-zsh* in your home directory (~/.oh-my-zsh/).

    wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh

### Install *most* pager

On debian:

    sudo apt-get install most

Here is how to define *most* as the default pager.
